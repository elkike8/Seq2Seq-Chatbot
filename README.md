#Seq2Seq-Chatbot

The purpose of this project was to create a chatbot using a Seq2Seq model based on LSTM Neural Networks. This model was trained over the SQuAD dataset, which contains content from Wikipedia in form of Questions and Answers. The goal was ending up with a chatting loop that coud take a general knowledge question by the user and generate a somewhat accurate answer based on its training upon a general body of knowledge. We used Tensorflow/Keras to achieve our purpose. 

The S2S South Park folder contains the original inspiration after which the final chatbot was designed. The S2S Movie folder contains anothe reference used to create the chat loop.

The final model and chatting loop is found in the squaderino file.
